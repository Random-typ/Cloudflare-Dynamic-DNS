# ðŸš€Cloudflare-Dynamic-DNS
Update your DNS records on Cloudflare Dynamically with every change of your ip adress. Who needs a static ip when you have this?  
The app is focused on easy setup and low resource usage at runtime.  
Set it up once, then forget about it and never care again about you DNS records.

# ðŸ§°Building yourself with Visual Studio
You will need RJSON which you can download [HERE](https://github.com/Random-typ/RJSON).
You need to put the RJSON folder up one folder from the Cloudflare-Dynamic-DNS folder. So that from the Cloudflare-Dynamic-DNS folder (where the solution file is placed), "..\\..\RJSON\RJSON\include\RJSON.h" is a valid path.\n
You will need Visual Studio with the .Net Desktop development with C#,  
C++ development and c++ development for Windows.
